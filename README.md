# InoTives DBT repos 

The purpose of this repos is to play around with DBT (Data Build Tool) by using data collected from my data-collectors repos. Trying to setup my own DBT that prebuild models that will be used for further analysis. 

## How to start

- To run all the models: `dbt run`
- To run selective models: `dbt run --select <model_name>`
- To run all test: `dbt test`
- To run selective test: `dbt test --select <test_name.sql>`
